Basic approaches to solve arrays

1.Brute force: This approach involves checking every possible combination of elements in the array. 
 It is the simplest approach but has a time complexity of O(n^2) or worse, making it inefficient for  large arrays.

2.Two pointers: This approach involves using two pointers to traverse the array, usually from opposite ends.
This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and is often used for problems that involve finding pairs of elements that satisfy a certain condition.
It is inefficient for large arrays

3.Sorting: This approach involves sorting the array and then using the sorted array to solve the problem.
Sorting has a time complexity of O(n log n), so it is less efficient than the two-pointer approach, but it can be useful in some situations.

4.Hash tables: This approach involves using a hash table or dictionary to store the elements of the array and their indices. 
This approach is often used for problems that involve finding duplicates orcounting occurrences of elements.

5.Dynamic programming: This approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem recursively. 
This approach is often used for problems that involve finding the maximum or minimum value of a subarray.

6.Sliding window: This approach involves maintaining a "window" of contiguous elements in the array and sliding the window along the array.
This approach is often used for problems that involve finding a subarray that satisfies a certain condition, such as the maximum sum subarray.
